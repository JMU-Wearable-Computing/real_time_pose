# Real Time Pose

Real Time Pose is a tool created by the wearable computing research group. Headed and advised by Dr. Jason Forsyth. The purpose of the tool is to provide a modular video feedback mechanism that can take a variety of input, process that input with a pose detection model, display the results of the model, and allow researchers to manipulate the displayed results for the purposes of feedback and direction.
